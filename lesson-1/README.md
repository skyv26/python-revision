# Lesson 1: Python Basics

## Introduction

Welcome to the first lesson on Python Basics! In this lesson, we will cover the foundational concepts that every Python programmer should know. We will start with the basics, including variables, data types, and basic operations. After that, we will review control structures like if statements and loops (for and while). To reinforce your learning, we will also work on small coding exercises.

## Section 1: Variables and Data Types

### Variables

A variable is a name that can store data. In Python, you can create a variable by assigning a value to it. For example:

```python
my_variable = 42
